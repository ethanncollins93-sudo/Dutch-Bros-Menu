    <h1>Complete Guide to the Dutch Bros Menu</h1>
    
    <div class="intro-section">
      <p>
        Dutch Bros Coffee has revolutionized the drive-thru coffee experience with over 800 locations across the United States. What sets Dutch Bros apart is its exceptional menu variety, genuine customer service, and the freedom to customize nearly every drink to your exact preferences. This guide breaks down everything you need to know about the Dutch Bros menu, from classic espresso drinks to their signature Rebel energy line.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Understanding the Dutch Bros Menu Structure</h2>
    <p>
      The Dutch Bros menu is organized into several core categories, each offering multiple customization options. Unlike traditional coffee shops with fixed recipes, Dutch Bros encourages customers to personalize drinks with different milk options, sweetness levels, and flavor combinations. This flexibility means you can create thousands of unique drink variations from a single base menu.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drinks are available in three sizes: small (16 oz), medium (24 oz), and large (32 oz). Most beverages can be ordered hot, iced, or blended, giving you control over texture and temperature regardless of the season.
    </p>

    <h2>Coffee & Espresso Drinks</h2>
    <p>
      Dutch Bros uses a proprietary three-bean espresso blend that delivers a smooth, bold flavor without excessive bitterness. The espresso menu includes all the classics you'd expect, plus some unique Dutch Bros twists.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Core Espresso Offerings</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Americano:</strong> Pure espresso diluted with hot water for a rich, bold taste</li>
      <li><strong>Latte:</strong> Espresso combined with steamed milk, customizable with any flavor syrup</li>
      <li><strong>Mocha:</strong> Chocolate and espresso blend, available with white, milk, or dark chocolate</li>
      <li><strong>Breve:</strong> Made with half-and-half instead of milk for an ultra-creamy texture</li>
      <li><strong>Cortado:</strong> Equal parts espresso and steamed milk for balanced intensity</li>
      <li><strong>Cappuccino:</strong> Espresso with equal parts steamed milk and foam</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Cold Brew Options</h3>
    <p>
      Dutch Bros cold brew is steeped for 12-18 hours, creating a naturally sweet, smooth coffee concentrate. It can be customized with sweet cream, flavored syrups, or enjoyed black. The cold brew serves as a base for specialty drinks like the Toasted Mellow Mocha (white chocolate, chocolate macadamia, and caramel) and the Chocolate Macadamia Nut cold brew.
    </p>

    <h2>Dutch Bros Rebel Energy Drinks</h2>
    <p>
      The Rebel line is Dutch Bros' proprietary energy drink, comparable to Red Bull but with a unique flavor profile. Rebels contain caffeine, taurine, and B-vitamins, providing an energy boost that can be customized with fruit flavors, cream, and syrups.
    </p>

    <div class="drink-category">
      <h3>Popular Rebel Combinations</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Aftershock:</strong> Strawberry and lime with blue raspberry for a sweet-tart energy kick</li>
        <li><strong>Ray of Sunshine:</strong> Blackberry, peach, and grapefruit for a fruity, refreshing taste</li>
        <li><strong>Unicorn Blood:</strong> Strawberry, white chocolate, and almond for a creamy, sweet Rebel</li>
        <li><strong>Electric Berry:</strong> Blue raspberry with a hint of lime and energy boost</li>
        <li><strong>Double Rainbro:</strong> Strawberry, peach, and coconut for a tropical energy drink</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>
      Rebels can be ordered plain with just the base energy drink, or loaded with cream and flavors. The blended versions create a slushie-like consistency perfect for hot days. Most Rebels contain 80mg of caffeine in a small, 114mg in a medium, and 160mg in a large.
    </p>

    <h2>Teas & Infusions</h2>
    <p>
      For those who prefer tea over coffee, Dutch Bros offers several options that can be customized just like any other drink. The tea menu includes both caffeinated and caffeine-free choices.
    </p>

    <h3>Tea Varieties</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Green Tea:</strong> Light and refreshing, can be sweetened and flavored</li>
      <li><strong>Black Tea:</strong> Bold flavor, pairs well with fruit or vanilla syrups</li>
      <li><li><strong>Paris Tea:</strong> Black tea with vanilla and caramel for a dessert-like experience</li>
      <li><strong>Passion Fruit Tea:</strong> Herbal infusion with tropical notes, naturally caffeine-free</li>
      <li><strong>Peach Tea:</strong> Green or black tea base with peach flavoring</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Lemonades & Refreshers</h2>
    <p>
      Dutch Bros lemonades are made fresh and can be blended with fruit flavors for a customized refresher. These drinks are ideal for customers looking for caffeine-free options or lighter alternatives to creamy coffee drinks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Popular lemonade combinations include strawberry lemonade, peach lemonade, and the "Gummy Bear" (featuring a mix of watermelon, pomegranate, and grapefruit). Lemonades can also be blended for a frozen treat similar to a slushie.
    </p>

    <h2>Seasonal & Limited-Time Offerings</h2>
    <p>
      Dutch Bros regularly rotates seasonal drinks that align with holidays and customer demand. These limited-time beverages often feature unique flavor combinations not available year-round.
    </p>

    <div class="highlight-box">
      <h3>Examples of Seasonal Drinks</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Fall:</strong> Pumpkin Breve, Caramel Pumpkin Mocha, Autumn Spice Chai</li>
        <li><strong>Winter:</strong> Peppermint Mocha, Candy Cane Rebel, White Chocolate Eggnog Latte</li>
        <li><strong>Spring:</strong> Lavender Cold Brew, Strawberry Shortcake Rebel</li>
        <li><strong>Summer:</strong> Watermelon Rebel, Peach Ring Tea, Mango Smoothie</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Secret Menu Items</h2>
    <p>
      The Dutch Bros "secret menu" isn't an official menu but rather a collection of customer-created drink combinations shared within the community. Baristas are trained to make these drinks if you provide the recipe or ingredient list.
    </p>
    <p>
      Popular secret menu items include the White Zombie (white chocolate, vanilla, and chocolate with breve), the Bob Marley (banana, chocolate, and coconut), and the Snickers (caramel, chocolate, and hazelnut). When ordering from the secret menu, be prepared to specify the exact flavors and base drink you want.
    </p>

    <h2>Customization Options</h2>
    <p>
      One of Dutch Bros' biggest advantages is the ability to tailor every drink to your preferences. Understanding these customization options helps you create your perfect beverage.
    </p>

    <h3>Milk Alternatives</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Whole milk (standard)</li>
      <li>2% milk</li>
      <li>Oat milk</li>
      <li>Almond milk</li>
      <li>Coconut milk</li>
      <li>Half-and-half (for breves)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Sweetness Levels</h3>
    <p>
      Drinks can be ordered with varying sweetness: less sweet (25% less syrup), regular, or extra sweet. You can also request sugar-free syrups in flavors like vanilla, caramel, and hazelnut, making it easier to enjoy Dutch Bros while managing sugar intake.
    </p>

    <h3>Add-Ons & Extras</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Extra espresso shots for added caffeine</li>
      <li>Soft top (sweet cream foam)</li>
      <li>Whipped cream</li>
      <li>Caramel or chocolate drizzle</li>
      <li>Extra flavor shots</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Nutrition & Dietary Considerations</h2>
    <p>
      Nutrition information varies significantly based on size, milk choice, and flavor additions. A standard medium latte with whole milk contains approximately 190 calories, while a blended Rebel with cream can exceed 400 calories.
    </p>
    <p>
      For those monitoring calorie intake, consider these modifications:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Choose iced or hot drinks over blended versions to reduce sugar content</li>
      <li>Use almond or oat milk instead of whole milk or half-and-half</li>
      <li>Request sugar-free syrups or reduce sweetness levels</li>
      <li>Skip the whipped cream and drizzle toppings</li>
      <li>Opt for tea or coffee-based drinks instead of Rebels</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Dutch Bros does not publish comprehensive nutrition facts for every possible drink combination, but general guidelines and specific drink information can be requested at any location.
    </p>
