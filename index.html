    <h1>Complete Guide to the Dutch Bros Menu</h1>

    <p>
      Dutch Bros Coffee has grown into one of the most recognizable drive-thru coffee chains
      in the United States. Known for its upbeat customer service, bold flavor combinations,
      and highly customizable drinks, Dutch Bros appeals to coffee lovers and non-coffee
      drinkers alike.
    </p>

    <p>
      Whether you are visiting for the first time or you are a loyal regular,
      understanding the Dutch Bros menu in advance can help you order faster,
      customize smarter, and discover drinks you may not have tried before.
    </p>

    <h2>Overview of the Dutch Bros Menu</h2>

    <p>
      The Dutch Bros menu is intentionally designed to offer something for everyone.
      It features espresso-based coffee drinks, cold brews, signature energy drinks,
      teas, lemonades, and rotating seasonal specials.
    </p>

    <p>
      One of the standout features is customization. Customers can control sweetness,
      select different milk options, mix flavors, and even choose caffeine levels.
      This flexibility makes the menu approachable for a wide range of preferences
      and dietary needs.
    </p>

    <h2>Coffee & Espresso Drinks</h2>

    <h3>Classic Espresso-Based Options</h3>

    <p>
      Dutch Bros serves a proprietary espresso blend that is smooth, rich,
      and well-balanced. Popular coffee drinks include lattes, americanos,
      cappuccinos, mochas, and breves.
    </p>

    <p>
      These drinks are available hot, iced, or blended, allowing customers
      to enjoy their coffee any time of year. Additional espresso shots,
      flavor syrups, and milk substitutions are easily added.
    </p>

    <h3>Cold Brew & Specialty Coffee</h3>

    <p>
      For those who prefer a smoother, less acidic coffee experience,
      Dutch Bros cold brew is a popular choice. It can be ordered plain
      or enhanced with cream, sweeteners, and signature flavor combinations.
    </p>

    <h2>Dutch Bros Rebel Energy Drinks</h2>

    <p>
      The Rebel energy drink line is one of the most iconic elements of the
      Dutch Bros menu. Rebels are known for their vibrant flavors and
      high level of customization.
    </p>

    <p>
      Customers can choose iced or blended Rebels and mix fruit syrups,
      creams, and toppings to create unique combinations.
      These drinks are especially popular among customers looking for
      a refreshing alternative to coffee.
    </p>

    <h2>Teas, Lemonades & Non-Coffee Options</h2>

    <p>
      Dutch Bros offers a variety of non-coffee drinks, including green tea,
      black tea, herbal tea, and house-made lemonades.
      These beverages can be served hot or iced and customized with fruit flavors.
    </p>

    <p>
      Many of these options are naturally lower in caffeine or completely
      caffeine-free, making them ideal for evening orders or customers
      sensitive to caffeine.
    </p>

    <h2>Seasonal & Secret Menu Items</h2>

    <p>
      Throughout the year, Dutch Bros introduces limited-time seasonal drinks
      inspired by holidays and customer favorites.
      These offerings often feature unique flavor profiles not found
      on the standard menu.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition, many customers enjoy ordering from the unofficial
      “secret menu,” which includes creative drink ideas shared
      by the Dutch Bros community. Availability may vary by location,
      but baristas are often happy to help recreate popular combinations.
    </p>

    <h2>Customization & Nutrition Information</h2>

    <p>
      Customization is a major reason for Dutch Bros’ popularity.
      Customers can request sugar-free syrups, dairy-free milk alternatives,
      reduced sweetness levels, or extra espresso shots.
    </p>

    <div class="highlight">
      <p>
        Nutrition values such as calories, sugar, and caffeine can vary
        significantly depending on drink size and customizations.
        Adjusting milk types, syrups, and toppings allows customers
        to better align drinks with their dietary preferences.
      </p>
